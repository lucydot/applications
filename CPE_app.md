### CPE International Exchange Scholarship Programme

**Student:** Lucy Whalley   
**Supervisor:** Aron Walsh  
**Host:** Professor Oba, Tokyo Institute of Technology

We propose an exchange with the research group of Professor Fumiyasu Oba at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. Professor Oba and his group use first-principles calculations to investigate the atomistic and electronic structure of point defects, surfaces, and interfaces in compound semiconductors.
We propose that Lucy would visit the Oba group from October to December 2019 (3 months). In exchange, we hope to host a member of the Oba group, Dr. Yu Kumagai.

The proposed title for this collaboration is "High throughput calculation of electron-hole recombination rates in semiconductors". This combines areas of expertise in the Walsh and Oba groups. We (the Walsh group) are developing a framework which calculates the carrier capture and recombination rates at point defects in semiconductors. This framework allows us to identify which defects are sites for non-radiative recombination, and will ultimately allow us to engineer point-defects for improved material performance, eg: photovoltaic materials with higher open circuit voltages. Early calculations have applied this framework to CZTS$^1$, and we are currently calculating the capture rates for point defects in GaAs and the hybrid halide perovskite CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$.
The Oba group are developing computational tools for high throughput first principles calculations. This allows systematic and automatic screening procedures for materials with target properties. Their previous work has enabled high throughput evaluation of band alignment$^2$, stability and dopability$^3$. We propose that Lucy integrates the framework used for calculating capture cross-sections into the high-throughput workflow developed by the Oba group. This exchange would build upon a succesful collaboration between the Walsh and Oba groups in 2016, which focussed upon screening procedures for matched contact layers in solar cells$^4$.

Lucy's PhD project is based around point defects in hybrid halide perovskites. We have predicted the existance of a halide split interstitial defect accompanied by a self-trapped hole$^5$ and we are currently calculating the carrier capture cross section for this process. This exchange would allow Lucy to increase the impact of her work, by extending the approach she is using to other materials. Lucy would also gain experience constructing a high-throughput workflow, which is a growing research area in materials science. Researchers in the Oba group would be able to apply our carrier capture framework across a range of materials, eg: the tin sulfides. We expect this collaboration would lead to a joint publication.
